![icon](icon.png)

# Installation:
- Download & extract the latest release .zip
- Download the Animal Crossing soundtrack of your choice (not included here, I have a healthy fear of Nintendo's lawyers)
- Copy your AC soundtrack files to the "audio" folder and rename them as so: 1PM.mp3 - 2PM.mp3, 1AM.mp3, 2AM.mp3
- Copy all of the files to "Q:\scripts\script.doubutsu"
- Run and enjoy!
- (Optional) If you want to run this automatically on startup, add "Q:\scripts\script.doubutsu\default.py" to "autoexec.py" in your "scripts" folder!

# TODO
- Set different audio source depending on season.
